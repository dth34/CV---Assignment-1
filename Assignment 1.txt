-The processing time for one image: Varies slightly, but around 1 ms

-The processing time with the bright spot detection: Around 100 ms

-The processing time is identical whether the image is displayed or not.

-The processing time with the loop method is similar, but varies more: Around 90 ms

-By moving my hand in front of the camera I can see a delay of roughly 1/10 of a second, which is coherent with the results above.

-Did not manage to get the live stream running.
